# TwistyKeys

Use a real cube as a controller for [Spineraks Twisty Cube](https://cube-ap.netlify.app) by converting moves into key presses

This tool is only compatible with the QiYi SmartCube (both variants should work), also called `QY SC-S` and `QY SC-A`

The physical cube does **not** know what side is facing which direction, therefore sides are mapped to fixed inputs:
 - Green always rotates the front face of the digital cube
 - Blue always rotates the back face of the digital cube
 - Orange always rotates the left face of the digital cube
 - Red always rotates the right face of the digital cube
 - White always rotates the top face of the digital cube
 - Yellow always rotates the bottom face of the digital cube
